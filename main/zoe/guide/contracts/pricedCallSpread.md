This contract implements a fully collateralized call spread. You can use a call spread as a
[financial building block](https://youtu.be/m5Pf2d1tHCs) to create futures, puts, calls, and event
binaries that would form the basis for a prediction market, insurance, and much more. A call spread
is a combination of a call option bought at one strike price and a second call option sold at a
higher price. A call spread has two participating seats that pay out complementary amounts depending
on the value of some good at a known future time. This video gives a
[walkthrough of the implementation](https://youtu.be/m5Pf2d1tHCs?t=3566) of the contract.

There are two variants of the callSpread.  In this version, the creator requests a pair of
invitations, each of which enables the holder to obtain one of the positions by providing a started
portion of the collateral. The other is called the [fundedCallSpread](./fundedCallSpread.md). It is
fully funded by its creator, who can then sell (or otherwise transfer) the options to other parties.
The Zoe invitations representing options are produced in pairs.  The individual options are Zoe
invitations whose details are inspectable by prospective purchasers.

These options are settled financially. There is no requirement that the original purchaser have
ownership of the underlying asset at the start, and the beneficiaries shouldn't expect to take
delivery at closing.

## Issuers

The Strike and Collateral currencies are often the same, however these contracts decouple the
currencies. You can have, for example, a spread based on APPL stock (`Underlying`), with the stock
price in USD (`Strike`) and contract paying out in JPY (`Collateral`).

The issuerKeywordRecord specifies issuers for three keywords: Underlying, Strike, and Collateral.
 * The asset whose eventual value determines the payouts uses `Underlying`. This is often a fungible
   currency, but doesn't have to be. It would be perfectly valid to have a call spread contract on
   the value of a "Superior Magic Sword", as long as there was a price oracle to determine its price
   at the expiration time.
 * The original deposit and the payout use the `Collateral` issuer.
 * `Strike` amounts are used for the price oracle's quote as to the value of the Underlying, as
   well as the strike prices in the terms.

## Terms

The terms include `{ timer, underlyingAmount, expiration, priceAuthority, strikePrice1,
strikePrice2, settlementAmount }`.
 * `timer` is a
   [timer](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/cosmic-swingset/TimerService.md),
   and must be recognized by `priceAuthority`.
 * `expiration` is a time recognized by the `timer`.
 * `underlyingAmount` is passed to `priceAuthority`. It could be an NFT or a fungible amount.
 * `strikePrice2` must be greater than `strikePrice1`.
 * `settlementAmount` is the amount deposited by the creator and split between the holders of the
 options. It uses Collateral.
 * `priceAuthority` is an oracle that has a timer so it can respond to requests for prices as of a
   stated time. After the deadline, it will issue a PriceQuote giving the value of the underlying
   asset in the strike currency.

## Creating the Option Invitations

The terms specify all the details of the options. A call to `creatorFacet.makeInvitationPair()` is
required to specify the share (as a whole number percentage in BigInt form) that will be contributed for the long
position. It returns a pair of invitations.

<<< @/snippets/zoe/contracts/test-callSpread.js#makeInvitationPriced

The creator gives these invitations to the two parties (or might retain one for their own use.) When
Bob receives an invitation, he can extract the value of the call spread option that he wants, and
create a proposal. The collateral required is also in the option's details. The holders of the
invitations can exercise with the required collateral to receive the actual call spread option
positions.

## Validating the Options

The options are packaged as invitations so they are fully self-describing, and can be verified with
Zoe, so their value is apparent to anyone who might be interested in them.

<<< @/snippets/zoe/contracts/test-callSpread.js#validatePricedInvitation

The details of the underlying call spread option are accessible from the terms associated with this
instance of the contract.

## Options can be Exercised Independently

 The option position invitations can be exercised for free, and provide their payouts under the
keyword `Collateral`.

<<< @/snippets/zoe/contracts/test-callSpread.js#bobExercise

The contract doesn't rely on the options being exercised before the specified close. If either
option is exercised after the closing price is determined, the payouts will still be available. The
two options make their payment available as soon after exercise as the price is available, and
neither waits for the other to exercise.
